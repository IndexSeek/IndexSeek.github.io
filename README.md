## About
I love working with data. I primarily work with Snowflake. I previously did a lot of work with Microsoft SQL Server, but I also occasionally dabbled with PostgreSQL. My work with SQL Server included Integration Services and Reporting Services. I like finding ways to make things "go faster". I also enjoy teaching others (and learning from others) different ways to do so.

I enjoy hearing from students, colleagues, managers, or anyone with similar interests. Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.
